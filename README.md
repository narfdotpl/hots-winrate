## Windows

I use macOS, but I've tried to run it on Windows. Here's what you need:

* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (to edit the script).
* Install [Git with Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (choose VS Code as the editor if you want).
* Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2717/).
* [Add Python to PATH](https://gist.github.com/roblanf/6929493).
* Use Git Bash to run the script.
